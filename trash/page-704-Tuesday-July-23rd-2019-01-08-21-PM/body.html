No, but of his own miracle. What says Jesus Christ? Does He speak of the evidence of the prophecies? No; His death had not fulfilled them. But He says, <em>Si non fecissem</em>. Believe the works.</p><p>Two supernatural foundations of our wholly supernatural religion; one visible, the other invisible; miracles with grace, miracles without grace.</p><p>The synagogue, which had been treated with love as a type of the Church, and with hatred, because it was only the type, has been restored, being on the point of falling when it was well with God, and thus a type.</p><p>Miracles prove the power which God has over hearts, by that which He exercises over bodies.</p><p>The Church has never approved a miracle among heretics.</p></div> </div>
