Is. lv; xlii, 1-7.</p><p>The prophecies are to be unintelligible to the wicked, Dan. xii; Hosea xiv, 10; but they are to be intelligible to those who are well informed.</p><p>The prophecies, which represent Him as poor, represent Him as master of the nations. Is. lii, 14, etc.; liii; Zech. ix, 9.</p><p>The prophecies, which foretell the time, foretell Him only as master of the nations and suffering, and not as in the clouds nor as judge. And those, which represent Him thus as judge and in glory, do not mention the time. When the Messiah is spoken of as great and glorious, it is as the judge of the world, and not its Redeemer.</p><p>He is to be the victim for the sins of the world. Is. xxxix, liii, etc.</p><p>He is to be the precious corner-stone. Is. xxviii, 16.</p></div> </div>
