<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>When we would pursue virtues to their extremes on either side, vices present themselves, which insinuate themselves insensibly there, in their insensible journey towards the infinitely little:  and vices present themselves in a crowd towards the infinitely great, so that we lose ourselves in them, and no longer see virtues. We find fault with perfection itself.</p><hr class="section"><p>Man is neither angel nor brute, and the unfortunate thing is that he who would act the angel acts the brute.</p><hr class="section"><p>We do not sustain ourselves in virtue by our own strength, but by the balancing of two opposed vices, just as we remain upright amidst two contrary gales. Remove one of the vices, and we fall into the other.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
