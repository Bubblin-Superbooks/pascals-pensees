<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p><em>Summum jus, summa injuria.</em></p><p>The majority is the best way, because it is visible, and has strength to make itself obeyed. Yet it is the opinion of the least able.</p><p>If men could have done it, they would have placed might in the hands of justice. But as might does not allow itself to be managed as men want, because it is a palpable quality, whereas justice is a spiritual quality of which men dispose as they please, they have placed justice in the hands of might. And thus that is called just which men are forced to obey.</p><p>Hence comes the right of the sword, for the sword gives a true right. Otherwise we should see violence on one side and justice on the other (end of the twelfth <em>Provincial</em>). Hence comes the injustice of the Fronde, which raises its alleged justice against power. It is not the same in the Church, for there is a true justice and no violence.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
