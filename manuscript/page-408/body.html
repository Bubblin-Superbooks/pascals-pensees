For both are equally under  obedience and dependent, both engaged in equally painful exercises. But the soldier always hopes to command, and never attains this, for even captains and princes are ever slaves and dependants; still he ever hopes and ever works to attain this.

So they do not differ in their perpetual thraldom, in which both of them always exist, but in the hope, which one always has, and the other never.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
