<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The world exists for the exercise of mercy and judgment, not as if men were placed in it out of the hands of God, but as hostile to God; and to them He grants by grace sufficient light, that they may return to Him, if they desire to seek and follow Him; and also that they may be punished, if they refuse to seek or follow Him.</p><hr class="section"><p>_That God has willed to hide Himself._â€”If there were only one religion, God would indeed be manifest. The same would be the case, if there were no martyrs but in our religion.</p><p>God being thus hidden, every religion which does not affirm that God is hidden, is not true; and every religion which does not give the reason of it, is not instructive. Our religion does, all this: <em>Vere tu es Deus absconditus.</em></p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
