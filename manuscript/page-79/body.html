Lewd words; this is bad, notwithstanding Mademoiselle de Gournay. Credulous;  _people without eyes</em>. Ignorant; <em>squaring the circle, a greater world</em>. His opinions on suicide, on death. He suggests an indifference about salvation, <em>without fear and without repentance</em>. As his book was not written with a religious purpose, he was not bound to mention religion; but it is always our duty not to turn men from it. One can excuse his rather free and licentious opinions on some relations of life (730,231); but one cannot excuse his thoroughly pagan views on death, for a man must renounce piety altogether, if he does not at least wish to die like a Christian. Now, through the whole of his book his only conception of death is a cowardly and effeminate one.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
