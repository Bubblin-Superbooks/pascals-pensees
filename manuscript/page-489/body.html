<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The longevity of the patriarchs, instead of causing the loss of past history, conduced, on the contrary, to its preservation. For the reason why we are sometimes insufficiently instructed in the history of our ancestors, is that we have never lived long with them, and that they are often dead before we have attained the age of reason. Now, when men lived so long, children lived long with their parents. They conversed long with them. But what else could be the subject of their talk save the history of their ancestors, since to that all history was reduced, and men did not study science or art, which now form a large part of daily conversation? We see also that in these days tribes took particular care to preserve their genealogies.</p><hr class="section"><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I believe that Joshua was the first of God's people to have this name, as Jesus Christ was the last of God's</p></div> </div>
