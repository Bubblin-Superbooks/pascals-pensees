<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>When we want to think of God, is there nothing which turns us away, and tempts us to think of something else? All this is bad, and is born in us.</p><hr class="section"><p>If there is a God, we must love Him only, and not the creatures of a day. The reasoning of the ungodly in the book of Wisdom is only based upon the non-existence of God. "On that supposition," say they, "let us take delight in the creatures." That is the worst that can happen. But if there were a God to love, they would not have come to this conclusion, but to quite the contrary. And this is the conclusion of the wise: "There is a God, let us therefore not take delight in the creatures."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Therefore all that incites us to attach ourselves to the creatures is bad; since it prevents us from serving God if we know Him, or from seeking Him if we know Him</p></div> </div>
