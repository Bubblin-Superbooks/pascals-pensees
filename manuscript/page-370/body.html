Our passions impel us outside, even when no objects present themselves to excite them. External objects tempt us of themselves, and call to us, even when we are not thinking of them. And thus philosophers have said in vain,  "Retire within yourselves, you will find your good there." We do not believe them, and those who believe them are the most empty and the most foolish.</p><hr class="section"><p>The Stoics say, "Retire within yourselves; it is there you will find your rest." And that is not true.</p><p>Others say, "Go out of yourselves; seek happiness in amusement." And this is not true. Illness comes.</p><p>Happiness is neither without us nor within us. It is in God, both without us and within us.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
