It is not of that light, "like the noonday sun," that this is said. We do  not say that those who seek the noonday sun, or water in the sea, shall find them; and hence the evidence of God must not be of this nature. So it tells us elsewhere: <em>Vere tu es Deus absconditus</em>.</p><hr class="section"><p>It is an astounding fact that no canonical writer has ever made use of nature to prove God. They all strive to make us believe in Him. David, Solomon, etc., have never said, "There is no void, therefore there is a God." They must have had more knowledge than the most learned people who came after them, and who have all made use of this argument. This is worthy of attention.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
