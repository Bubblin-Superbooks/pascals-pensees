<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Scripture in that passage, speaking of the enemy, means the evil leaven; and that, in [_giving_] him that bread and that water, we heap coals of fire on his head.</p><p><em>Midrasch el Kohelet</em> on Ecclesiastes ix, 14: "A great king besieged a little city." This great king is the evil leaven; the great bulwarks built against it are temptations; and there has been found a poor wise man who has delivered itâ€”that is to say, virtue.</p><p>And on Psalm xli, 1: "Blessed is he that considereth the poor."</p><p>And on Psalm lxxviii, 39: "The spirit passeth away, and cometh not again"; whence some have erroneously argued against the immortality of the soul. But the sense is that this spirit is the evil leaven, which accompanies man till death, and will not return at the resurrection.</p><p>And on Psalm ciii the same thing.</p><p>And on Psalm xvi.</p></div> </div>
