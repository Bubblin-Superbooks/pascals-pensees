<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>It is a singular thing to consider that there are people in the world who, having renounced all the laws of God and nature, have made laws for themselves which they strictly obey, as, for instance, the soldiers of Mahomet, robbers, heretics, etc. It is the same with logicians. It seems that their licence must be without any limits or barriers, since they have broken through so many that are so just and sacred.</p><hr class="section"><p>All the principles of sceptics, stoics, atheists, etc., are true. But their conclusions are false, because the opposite principles are also true.</p><hr class="section"><p>_Instinct, reason._â€”We have an incapacity of proof, insurmountable by all dogmatism. We have an idea of truth, invincible to all scepticism.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
