<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>---No; for in acting as we do to oblige everybody, we give no more occasion for hatred of us.â€”That is true, if we only hated in Self the vexation which comes to us from it. But if I hate it because it is unjust, and because it makes itself the centre of everything, I shall always hate it.</p><p>In a word, the Self has two qualities: it is unjust in itself since it makes itself the centre of everything; it is inconvenient to others since it would enslave them; for each Self is the enemy, and would like to be the tyrant of all others. You take away its inconvenience, but not its injustice, and so you do not render it lovable to those who hate injustice; you render it lovable only to the unjust, who do not any longer find in it an enemy. And thus you remain unjust, and can please only the unjust.</p><hr class="section"><p class=" stretch-last-line ">It is a perverted judgment that makes every one place</p></div> </div>
