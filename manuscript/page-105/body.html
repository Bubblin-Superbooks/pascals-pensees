<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>What but this faculty of imagination dispenses reputation,  awards respect and veneration to persons, works, laws, and the great? How insufficient are all the riches of the earth without her consent!</p><p>Would you not say that this magistrate, whose venerable age commands the respect of a whole people, is governed by pure and lofty reason, and that he judges causes according to their true nature without considering those mere trifles which only affect the imagination of the weak? See him go to sermon, full of devout zeal, strengthening his reason with the ardour of his love. He is ready to listen with exemplary respect. Let the preacher appear, and let nature have given him a hoarse voice or a comical cast of countenance, or let his barber have given him a bad shave, or let by chance his dress be more dirtied than usual, then however great the truths he announces. I wager our senator loses his gravity.</p></div> </div>
