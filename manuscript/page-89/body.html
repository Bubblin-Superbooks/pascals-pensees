Too great length and too great brevity of discourse tend to obscurity; too much truth is paralysing (I know some who cannot understand that to take four from nothing leaves nothing).

Too many concords are annoying in music; too many benefits irritate us; we wish to have the wherewithal to over-pay our debts. <em>Beneficia eo usque l√¶ta sunt dum videntur exsolvi posse; ubi multum antevenere, pro gratia odium redditur.</em> We feel neither extreme heat nor extreme cold. Excessive qualities are prejudicial to us and not perceptible by the senses; we do not feel but suffer them. Extreme youth and extreme age hinder the mind, as also too much and too little education.

They escape us, or we them.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">This is our true state; this is what makes us incapable</p></div> </div>
