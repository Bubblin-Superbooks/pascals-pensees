But they should choose well; for, if they spend all their efforts in the interests of fools, it will be of no use, however well these may speak of them; and these will not even speak well of them if  they find themselves on the weakest side, for they have no influence; and thus they will speak ill of them in company.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
